# 🏋️‍♀️ WorkoutProgram

**WorkoutProgram** is a web application that guides users through a 30-day training program, split into **Push**, **Pull**, and **Legs** routines. Progress is saved locally, and workouts unlock progressively as you complete each day.
This project was built as a practical exercise to apply React, Vite, LocalStorage and clean code when possible.
